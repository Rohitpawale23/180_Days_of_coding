    /*

    Time Complexity
    Time required for execution of algorithm
    Number of steps requied for execution
    it depends on number of inputs

    Rule(1) - Ignore the constant terms
     ex - 3n +1 --> O(n)

    Rule(2) - Take highest value after ignoring the constant term
    ex -  n^3 + n^2 + n  => O(n^3)

    it has three cases

    best

    worst

    /*

    SPACE complexity

    space of memory taken by an algorithm
    as afunction of length of input

    it has two types
    Auxillary space // used many times
    and Total space complexity

    ex - for array
    Auxillary space => O(n)

    Total Space => n+n = 2n => O(n)
