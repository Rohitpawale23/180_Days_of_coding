// DAY 81 - Time and Space Complexity of Recursion


/*
Total timr taken by an algorithm to run as an function of its input side

method - By using recursive tree
we can easily able to findout time complexity of an algorithm
- maximum height of recursive tree side is selected


-Space Complexity
maximum size of stack in which data will be stored 
is known as space complexity
